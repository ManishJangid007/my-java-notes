Type Of Primitive Data Type in Java:-

1. Byte - The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive).

2. Short - The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive).
        the same guidelines apply: you can use a short to save memory in large arrays, in situations where the memory savings actually matters.

3. Int - By default, the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -231 and a maximum value of 231-1. 
        In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the int data type to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 232-1. 
        Use the Integer class to use int data type as an unsigned integer.                     

4. Long - The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. The signed long has a minimum value of -263 and a maximum value of 263-1. In Java SE 8 and later, 
        you can use the long data type to represent an unsigned 64-bit long, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 264-1.               

5. Float - a float is a data type composed of a number that is not an integer, because it includes a fraction represented in decimal format.
        Some point out that the float data type is used in computer programming when more precision is needed than what integers can provide.(32 bit)

6. Double - The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion, 
        but is specified in the Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values section of the Java Language Specification.
        For decimal values, this data type is generally the default choice. As mentioned above, this data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency.

7. Boolean - The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false. Use this data type for simple flags that track true/false conditions. 
        This data type represents one bit of information, but its "size" isn't something that's precisely defined.

8. char - The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).


Type Of Non-Primitive Data Type in Java:-

9. String - In Java, string is basically an object that represents sequence of char values. 
        An array of characters works same as Java string. 
        For example: char[] ch={'j','a','v','a','t','p','o','i','n','t'}; 
                        String s=new String(ch);

                        or 
        
        A Java string is a sequence of characters that exist as an object of the class java.
        Java strings are created and manipulated through the string class. Once created, a string is immutable 
        -- its value cannot be changed.

10. Array - An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. 
        The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.

                        or
        
        Array is a collection of homogenous Data Types stored in continous memory location.
