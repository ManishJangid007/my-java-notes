Implicit TypeCasting :- In implicit typecasting, the conversion involves a smaller data type to the larger type size. 
                For example, the byte datatype implicitly typecast into short, char, int, long, float, and double. 
                The process of converting the lower data type to that of a higher data type is referred to as Widening

        Example =   int a = 100;
		            System.out.println("Int : " + a);

		            long b = a;
		            System.out.println("Long : " + b);

                    float c = b;
                    System.out.println("Float : " + c);

Explicit TypeCasting :- Converting a higher data type into a lower one is called narrowing type casting. 
                It is also known as explicit conversion or casting up. It is done manually by the programmer. 
                If we do not perform casting then the compiler reports a compile-time error.

        Example =   double a = 50.50;
                    System.out.println("Double : " + a);

                    float f = (float) a;
                    System.out.println("Float : " + f);

                    long b = (long) a;
                    System.out.println("Long : " + b);

                    int c = (int) b;
                    System.out.println("Int : " + c);
